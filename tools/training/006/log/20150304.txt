In Python3.3+, you could use contextlib.ExitStack. In Python2 (or older versions of Python3), you could use contextlib2.ExitStack, which is installable with

pip install contextlib2
try:
    import contextlib
    contextlib.ExitStack
except AttributeError:
    import contextlib2 as contextlib

partnames = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
with contextlib.ExitStack() as stack:
    # All opened files will automatically be closed at the end of
    # the with statement, even if attempts to open files later
    # in the list raise an exception
    files = [stack.enter_context(open(name, "w+")) for name in partnames]
    print(files)
