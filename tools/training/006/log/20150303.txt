contextlib is not deprecated, but contextlib.nested() is, as it won't handle exceptions when opening correctly. 每  Martijn Pieters 1 hour ago

Since you open them only for write, isn't it possible to write to the files one after another? I usually hate those questions but do you really need to have them open all at the same time? Otherwise you could use with open(name, "w+") as fileobj: within a foreach loop over the names. Which would actually be the preferred way afaik. 每  swenzel 1 hour ago
  	 	
If you use the try/finally approach, the trick is to use a for loop that has a try/except clause so that you continue after exceptions. 每  tdelaney 32 mins ago
