I am trying to use the Human Api Python client with GAE.

I created a appengine_config.py and followed all instructions as described in Third-party Libraries in Python 2.7 documentation for GAE

My appengine_config.py looks like:

"""This file is loaded when starting a new application instance."""

from google.appengine.ext import vendor

# Add any libraries installed in the "lib" folder.
vendor.add('lib')
My requirements.txt looks like so:

HumanAPI
... and installs correctly:
